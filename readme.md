#hideandseek

Hide and Seek in Gamla Stan (formerly http://hideandseek.ninja) was a Facebook event which I helped create in May 2015. All told, just under a thousand people gathered in Stockholm, Sweden one summer's day and played a massive outdoors game of Hide and Seek. We accomplished this legally and without on-site instruction, which made the game scaleable: at one point, several thousand people were attending on Facebook. I document its conception and creation in the article [Design and Operation of a Crowd-Run Distributed Outdoor Game](http://ambuc.github.io/distributed-outdoor-game/).
